#### ERSP Initial Thoughts
> This is what I am most excited about in ERSP:
* So for a long time, "doing research" is considered as a very mysterious and advanced work that can only be done by a small highly-educated group of people. But ERSP gives undergraduate students opprtunities to conduct research on their own--which is an awesome idea. I want to feel, think, and engage in such a special experience of researching.

> This is what I am most nervous about in ERSP:
* I feel somewhat nervous about participating in a one-year-long study. I don't know if I can stay energetic and passionate about the project for such a long time. Meanwhile, I think currently I do not have enough knowledge to support such a research in an unkown field.
